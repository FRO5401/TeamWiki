Steps:
| Step & Direction      | Expected Result   
|--------------|-----------|
|Bring the battery close to the robot.|The battery should be in a position where you can easily place it where it needs to go.|
|Put the battery in the correct place (provide image)|The battery should fit into the slot and the cords should be close enough to be plugged in.|
|Plug that cords into the slots with the corresponding color (provide image)|The robot should be receiving power from the battery when the switch is pushed in.|

**Obtain a Functional Driver Station**\
Description: In order to run robot code and control the robot, you need a Driver Station(Computer with the Driver Station software)\
Pre-condition: Obtain a computer (It can be your own or a random one from robotics).

Steps:
| Step & Direction      | Expected Result   
|--------------|-----------|

|Download [Github](https://github.com) |You should be able to open the Github Desktop App.|
|Get the Github Extension in V.S. Code by opening V.S. Code and going to Source Control.|The Github Extension of V.S. Code should be downloaded, making it easier to make commits.|
|Log into Github.|You should have access to your Github account and repositories.|

**Provide a Functional Radio for the Robot**\
Description: The robot needs a functioning radio to connect to a Driver Station.\
Pre-condition:
- Obtain a Functional Driver Station
- Get a new radio from the Pit

Steps:
| Step & Direction      | Expected Result   
|--------------|-----------|
|Download the FRC Radio Configuration Utility software! [Link!](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html)|You should be able to open the FRC Radio Configuration Utility.|
|Get an ethernet cable from the Pit.|You should have an ethernet cable.|
|Get a radio power brick from the Pit.|You should have a power brick to charge the radio while configuring it.|
|Plug in the new radio to give it a source of power( to a robot or an outlet).|The power light should start blinking.|
|Plug the ethernet cable into the radio and your Driver Station(Use the port that the software tells you to).|The ethernet light should turn on.|
|Open the FRC Radio Configuration Utility.|You should see a pop-up asking you to pick your network interface.|
|Select ethernet as your network interface and press Okay.|You should see the FRC Radio Configuration Utility interface.|
|Enter the team number as 5401 and enter an appropriate robot name.|The team number and name should be entered.|
|Check if the power light is not blinking.|The power light should be solid and not blinking.|
|Load the firmware.|The firmware load should be successful.|
|Press Configure.|The configuration should be successful.|
