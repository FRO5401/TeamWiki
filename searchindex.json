For a CyberSecurity Engineer or Penetration Tester, they are trying to ethically hack into systems to ensure they are secure. An Embedded Systems Engineer will need to communicate with microcontrollers via the commandline. A Front-end and back-end developer will use commandline tools like Node and build tools like MAKE or GitHub Actions to build their code automatically. Lastly, if you want to have a personal server (I.E. A personal iCloud or Google Drive), most times if the User-Interface for the server goes down you will need to use the commandline to start the software/server. Having a basic understanding of the commandline will only be a benefit to your learning!\nFor the following tutorial we will be using Git Bash on Windows and Terminal on Mac/Linux\nTraversing the File Tree It is important to view your computer\u0026rsquo;s file structure as a tree. Where the root is the beginning of your hard drive that branches off into sub-branches containing files and other folders. First, we will start off with just navigating this tree.\nPWD: present working directory The first command we will discuss is pwd which stands for present working directory. This command will show you were your terminal currently set to. Think of it like your File Explorer that tells you the current folder you are look at, pwd does the same thing. It returns to you what\u0026rsquo;s called a file path.\nWindows File Path C:\\Users\\FRO\\Downloads Linux/MacOS File Path /home/FRO/Downloads\n/ vs ~/ Like a tree, our file system has a root. Actually it has two, the root and user-root. The root is the base of the hard drive which is denoted by path /. User-root is your user folder where all information about your profile is saved. Your Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Pictures, and Video folders live here, this path is C:\\Users\\FRO which also can be denoted as ~/.\nCD: Change Directory To traverse the file tree we need to change directories both up and down the document tree. The cd command does just this, to use it you just need to provide 1 parameter, where you want to go. For example, from the user root directory (~/ or C:\\Users\\FRO), if we want to navigate to the Desktop, we would say cd Desktop. Like many commands but especially for file paths and names, case matters! Desktop and desktop are not the same, since the user (you) can name files anything they want. Once we are on the desktop, C:\\Users\\FRO\\Desktop to go back we to user-root we can either say cd ~/ or cd ..\\ both do the same thing in this context. ..\\ means to go up the parent directory from the current directory. Desktop\u0026rsquo;s parent is our user-root. If there is a folder on the desktop called 2023_Robot_Code that was at C:\\Users\\FRO\\Desktop\\2023_Robot_Code, cd ~/ and cd ..\\ would NOT do the same thing. ~/ would still take you to the user-root but ..\\ would go up to the Desktop directory (C:\\Users\\FRO\\Desktop) since it is the parent of 2023_Robot_Code.\nLS: List When using File Explorer we will see files in a given folder, cd only takes us to the folder but does not show us what the contents are. That is where the ls command comes in. It will show you all files you would see File Explorer in the terminal output. However there are \u0026lsquo;hidden files\u0026rsquo; that are prefixed with a . in-front of their name, a common example is .gitignore. To see these files you will say ls -la, this will show hidden files as well as the file/folder owner, the creation/edit date, and the file permissions. All of which are outside the scope of this basic tutorial.\nCreating, Viewing, \u0026amp; Deleting Files \u0026amp; Folders touch: Creating Files To create a file(s) simply navigate to the directory you want them to reside in and use the touch command and just pass in the name of the file you\u0026rsquo;d like to create. For example to make a file called main.java you would say touch main.java. To create more than 1 file, just seperate the names by a space, mkdir main.java Constants.java Arm.java. It is important to add the file extension to the end of the filename so your computer knows what type of file you created\nmkdir: Make Directories To create a directory(s) simply navigate to the directory you want them to reside in and use the mkdir command and just pass in the name of the directory you\u0026rsquo;d like to create. For example to make a directory called 2024_Build_Season you would say mkdir 2024_Build_Season. To create more than 1 folder, just seperate the names by a space, mkdir 2024_Build_Season 2025_Build_Season 2026_Build_Season.\nrm vs rm -rf Just like how there are two different commands to create files and folders, there are two different commands to delete them. Use rm and the name of file(s) and rm -rf and the name of directory(s) to delete their respective item.\nrm main.java Constants.java Arm.java to remove the example files\nrm -rf 2024_Build_Season 2025_Build_Season 2026_Build_Season to remove the example directories.\ncat: catenate To view the contents of files you can say cat \u0026lt;Path to file\u0026gt;. CAT can merge multiple files into 1 and edit multiple files at once. Again, that is out of the scope of this tutorial but feel free to research its other applications.\nBasic Git Commits These commands are meant to replace your need for GitHub Desktop. Hopefully you will find that this is way quicker than opening another application and clicking multiple buttons. There are still other functions that you will need to use GitHub Desktop for, but these are your most common ones.\ngit status This command will show you files in the repo that have been modified, added, or deleted. Simply use git status in the the terminal. Example output below:\nOn branch Commandline-Basics Your branch is up to date with \u0026#39;origin/Commandline-Basics\u0026#39;. Changes not staged for commit: (use \u0026#34;git add \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026#34; to update what will be committed) (use \u0026#34;git restore \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026#34; to discard changes in working directory) modified: content/english/programming/commandline_basics.md no changes added to commit (use \u0026#34;git add\u0026#34; and/or \u0026#34;git commit -a\u0026#34;) git add This command will add a file or files to staged, allowing you to perform subsequent commands on those files. Two examples are git add \u0026lt;path to a specific file\u0026gt; and git add ., the first will add only 1 file where the other will add ALL files that have been changed/added/deleted\ngit commit -m \u0026quot;\u0026quot; This command commits the files that were staged with git add with a message of your choice. For the message itself, there are multiple conventions on what to say. One example is called conventional commits and other is just adding a single sentence of what you did. Example command would be git commit -m \u0026quot;feat: added commandline basics page\u0026quot;\ngit push This command pushes commits or branches from your local machine to your remote branch(GitHub). For pushing commits you can just say git push. For pushing a new branch for the FIRST time, you can use git push --set-upstream origin \u0026lt;Name of Branch\u0026gt;.\ngit checkout Checkout allows you to change and create branches. To switch to the main branch from any other, you can say git checkout main. To create a new branch based on the current one your on, which you can get from git status , you will say git checkout -b \u0026quot;\u0026lt;Name of NEW branch\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\nAdvanced: Using VIM to modify files VIM stands for \u0026ldquo;Visual Instrument iMproved\u0026rdquo; which is a way to edit files from the terminal. If you need to edit a single file, you can do you pretty easily with VIM. It is recommended for you guys just getting started to use VS Code to edit multiple files. It is encourage for you to experiment using VIM and get familiar with it. There are other terminal editors such as nano and vi but Jimmy\u0026rsquo;s personal recommendation is vim.\nHere are some links to edit files:\nVIM Tutorial - (Text) VIM Tutorial - (Video) Nano Tutorial - (Text) Nano Tutorial - (Video) VI Tutorial - (Text) VI Tutorial - (Video) Where to go from here Git Rebase / Reset Chmod bash scripting PowerShell "},{"section":"Assembly","slug":"/assembly/frc-robot-basics/","title":"FRC Robot Basics","description":"","date":"January 1, 1","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/robotBasics_hu7c3973567af5497ad6b325be5a56901f_174102_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"212\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/robotBasics_hu7c3973567af5497ad6b325be5a56901f_174102_420x0_resize_lanczos_3.PNG';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/robotBasics_hu7c3973567af5497ad6b325be5a56901f_174102_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/robotBasics_hu7c3973567af5497ad6b325be5a56901f_174102_100x100_fill_lanczos_smart1_3.PNG';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Assembly","tags":"","content":""},{"section":"Programming","slug":"/programming/programming-resources/","title":"General Programming Resources","description":"","date":"January 1, 1","image":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/prosources_hu9b865f046bbb7b22487975e05d3994cd_314491_420x0_resize_q80_h2_lanczos_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"420\"\n          height=\"210\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/prosources_hu9b865f046bbb7b22487975e05d3994cd_314491_420x0_resize_lanczos_3.PNG';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","imageSM":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n\n\n        \n        \n\n\n        \u003cimg\n          \n            src=\"/images/prosources_hu9b865f046bbb7b22487975e05d3994cd_314491_100x100_fill_q80_h2_lanczos_smart1_3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\"\n          \n\n          alt=\"\"\n          class=\"  img\"\n          width=\"100\"\n          height=\"100\"\n          onerror=\"this.onerror='null';this.src='\\/images\\/prosources_hu9b865f046bbb7b22487975e05d3994cd_314491_100x100_fill_lanczos_smart1_3.PNG';\" /\u003e\n\n        \n      \n      \n    \n    \n  \n\n\n  \n","searchKeyword":"","categories":"Programming","tags":"","content":"Here are resources to learn/troubleshoot coding questions you may have.\nWebsite How it Helps Java Programming with Josh Video - Java Basics from the Beginning W3School Java Wiki - Java Topics separated by page Solo Learn Mobile/Web Module based learning for any language Codecademy Web Module based learning for any language Stack Overflow Wiki - Community-based questions/answer blog.

There is no clickable user interface with a mouse, everything happens from your keyboard. There are two main types of terminals with syntactical differences but they generally can perform the same actions. Bash is the terminal on Linux or MacOS devices whereas CMD runs on Windows. The benefit of using the command line is that your fingers stay on the keyboard \u0026amp; nearly anything you can do with the mouse can be done in less time the command line.\nWhile you’re here at robotics you mostly will be using CMD, unless you choose to learn Linux (which I recommend to the upperclassman). For the command line, you will use it mostly for copying files, creating folders, \u0026amp; git.\n‘What is git?’ you might be asking, it is a software version control protocol that allows multiple users/machines to work on a codebase at a time. Git allows users to pull, push, merge, \u0026amp; revert code from a server. Here we will discuss how to perform basic git commands, there are more complicated commands but we just need you to know these basics.\nFor a full tutorial of git please use the following resources:\nhttps://ohmygit.org/ https://www.w3schools.com/git/ Team Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j5qtgoRv2GGTz7wum2VJOVj4y_qC2zrYVYq54Ko1uc8/edit?usp=sharing Initialize a new Repo\nYou probably will not need to do this often for robotics but if you ever need to start a new project you’d like in git do the following.\ngit init git commit -m “initial commit” Clone Repo\nCloning a repo means, as the name suggests, get a local copy of a repository that is in git. You can do this to brand new repository or an established one. Here Is an example to clone the 2023 First Powerup Repo.\nGo to GitHub.com Click your user icon \u0026amp; select Your Organizations Select Team5401 Find the repo you’d like to clone, in our case ChargedUp2023 \u0026amp; select it Select the big green Code button, then make sure that the HTTPS button is selected, \u0026amp; finally, click the copy button next to url Open your terminal, can cd to the folder you want to clone the repo to. For example, if I wanted to cd to the Documents folder. If you want to go to a folder inside of the documents called Programming, use the second command. cd Documents or cd Documents \\ Programming Lastly, run the following command, but instead of pasting in \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;link to repo\u0026gt;,\u0026rdquo; paste the link you copied from GitHub. git clone \\\u0026lt;link to repo\\\u0026gt; Committing Code\nCommitting means taking code that you have written \u0026amp; sending them to the parent repository. Commits can be small, like fixing a typo in a comment, or large, such as an entire sub-system for the robot (not preferred). A question you may be asking is, “When should I commit?”, and that is a tricky question.\nThere is no standard answer but there is a motto that says to commit “early \u0026amp; often”. The idea is that the more commits there are, the more points there are to revert to in the future. Imagine you commit code that breaks the robot, if you commit very infrequently when you have to revert a lot of code will change even if there is a tiny bug. In general, every time you have a new working aspect of your code, it should be committed. For example, if you are coding the drive base for autonomous here are suggested commit points\nCreating the new Java file with boilerplate Accessing drive-base \u0026amp; sensor classes Calling the autonomous from main code |git commit -m “\\\u0026lt;some message here\\\u0026gt;” Your commit messages should be specific to what was done \u0026amp; be a sentence @ max \u0026amp; minimum. Examples messages:\n“Created new autonomous file” “Meshing sensor \u0026amp; drivebase data” “Finalized autonomous \u0026amp; called it from main” Pushing / Pulling code\nPushing code means taking committed code from your local machine to the remote branch. Pulling code does the opposite, it takes code that is in the remote branch to your master branch. If your code locally doesn’t match up with the remote branch there may be merge conflicts that require a rebase. If so, seek out the programming lead or mentor.\ngit pull git push Creating / Checking out Branch\nA branch is the separate progression of code away from the main branch. Branches allow you to work on a new feature \u0026amp; test it with the full code base while it’s still in development. When you’re done with the feature, you will need to make a Pull Request to merge your branch into the master branch. To create a new branch off of master do the following:\ncd \\\u0026lt;file path to repo\\\u0026gt; git checkout master git pull git checkout -b ‘\\\u0026lt;name of new branch\\\u0026gt; Pull requests\nWhen your feature is done \u0026amp; ready to be tested \u0026amp; merged, a Pull Request needs to be created from GitHub.\nNavigate to the GitHub repo, such as Crescendo2024 Select Pull Request \u0026amp; New Pull Request Select the compare dropdown \u0026amp; find the name of your branch Select Create Pull Request Fill in the title of the PR as the name of the issue you are working on. Inside GitHub Projects, there should be a name for your issue, place that name where it says ‘Swerve drive base in this photo. For the description, use a bulleted list to describe snippets of everything your PR does.

As we have discussed in your training, classes must start with a Capital letter, and variables \u0026amp; functions must be in camel case (ex. thisIsWhatCamelCaseShouldLookLike). This section refers to what the actual name of your variables, functions, and classes should be called.\nVariable Naming convention Motors Drivebase For tank drive, we typically have 2 or 3 motors inside of the planetary gearbox. Since the gearbox motors all turn at the same speed and direction in the gearbox, we assume they are actually just 1 unit. As such we will never power 1 motor different than the rest so the naming in code for each motor does not matter. In general, follow this example here from Charged Up: rightDrive1, leftDrive3.\nNon-Drivebase For non-drivebase motors, the location \u0026amp; function of them is important. We need to ensure that these names are concise but explain their purpose. Ex. openClawMotor, rotateArmMotor, leftArmRotateMotor, rightArmRotateMotor\nInfo to include in variables Includes Action Includes Where it is Convention: actionLocationMotor\nCameras If the robot comes equipped with cameras naming should indicate WHERE the camera is \u0026amp; WHAT the camera is looking for. For example, driveBaseInfeedCamera or clawBallDetectionCamera\nEncoders For the most part, follow the same name as the motor the encoder is paired with and append Encoder to the end.\nPID Numbering
